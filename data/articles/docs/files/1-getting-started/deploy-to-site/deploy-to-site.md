# Deploy your app to a site

In the previous guide we went over creating your first app with Collections, Views and Routes. Our next step is to deploy what we've built to actual users. To do that we'll need to do a few things.

1. Set our landing or "home" route. This is the route that users are directed to if they just go to the base url for your site.
2. Create a Permssion Set and Profile for the public user. These permissions are given to any user who visits your site and has not logged in.
3. Package your app into a bundle. This will take the current state of your workspace and turn it into a bundle that can be deployed.
4. Create a site and give it a domain. This will allow users to access your app from the ues.io domain on the subdomain you choose.
5. Add some data to your site through the studio collection admin screen.

Let's get started!

## 1. Set a home route to your app

In your workspace, click on the Routes navigation tile, and then click the "Edit" button.
