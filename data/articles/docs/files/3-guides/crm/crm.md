### Why did we do this?  
We want to showcase the development capabilities of ues.io and decided to build a CRM app as an example of what can be done in a short space of time and some of the functionality that can be introduced to your own apps. You can build other apps in a similar way and either list them in the ues.io [Bundle Store](https://docs.ues.io/bundle-store) for users to subscribe to or as an internal app for your organisation.
### What is included?
